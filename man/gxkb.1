.PP
gxkb is a little indicator applet which allows one to quickly
switch between different keyboard layouts in X. A flag
corresponding to the country of the active layout is shown
in the indicator area.

The applet is written in C and uses the GTK+ library and
therefore does not depend on any GNOME components.
